### Git cheat sheet

### Linking an existing local project to a remote github repository

`git remote add origin https://github.com/georgemillard/The-Hive.git`

Verify remote:
`git remote -v`

Set branch master to follow remote:
`git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master`

### Creating a new branch

`git branch`

`git pull origin master'
Make sure master branch is up to date
